# Free Saint App

Free Saint is a health tech company focused on creating the "uber" scheduling app for health-related soulpreneuers. This minimum viable prototype includes a weight loss mobile app. The objective of the survey funnel is as follows:

    -The user can input their daily food logs that can be selected by diet types
    -The user can view the history of their daily food logs
    -The user will be able to access a weight loss recommender that allocates foods by caloric density
    
# Three Year Plan

As this prototype develops, it will iterate with user journey stories and client interviews. The goal of this app in the next 12-months include: 

    -Building a machine learning algorithm that "learns" how to best optimize an algorithm that I will build called the Metabolism Maximizer
    -The science behind the recently discovered stomach hormone called Ghrelin and Leptin and the research momentum to find a way to manipulate Ghrelin-blockers to treat obesity
    -GHS (growth hormone secretagogues) such as MK-677 Ibutamoren Mesylate have been reported by NIH to mimic the gastric peptide hormone Grhelin as an approach to increase metabolism, act as a samatoastation antagonists to reduce cortisol, and enhace the activity of growth hormones
    -Partnership with a well-known endocronoligist for new approaches to lipolysis (fat burning)

# What The App Looks Like

The challenges in developing this product:

    -I had to plan three years ahead to know where to start prior to client interviews to guide the iteration of this project
    -The food log is critically important for weight loss and so I started with this functionality
    -The backend infrastructure of the MERN stack has been established
    -Due to the complexity of the development, I spent a lot of time on the Figma Wireframes, the ERD (entity relationship diagram), and the three year vision

# Next Steps

Planned future enhancements include:

    -Branded user design
    -Client iterations
    -AI algorithms that "learns" optimal strategies for diet plans (and what diets an individual should follow), behavior and emotional guidance, and data-based daily intake strategies
    -iPhone and Android app for recipes, health provider director
    -an ecommerce shopping engine
    -API integrations with health-related data resources
    -a marketing ecosystem built in Salesforces Apex language for health coaches, personal trainers, nutritionists, endocrinologists, embodiment coaches, accupunturists and sleep experts
    -Saas for global fungible value chain including "first" and "last" mile logistics, fulfillment and order management for health-related soulpreneuers
